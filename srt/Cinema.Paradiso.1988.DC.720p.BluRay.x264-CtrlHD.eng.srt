1
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,339
Yes, Salvatore di Vita.

2
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,847
You mean you don't know him, Miss?

3
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,600
That's right, and I'm his mother.

4
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,856
I've been calling from Sicily,
all day long.

5
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,319
I see... he's not there.

6
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,700
Could you please give me
his number?

7
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:44,665
656 22 056.

8
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,876
Thank you. Goodbye.

9
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,757
It's useless to call.

10
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,760
He's busy.
God knows where he is.

11
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,138
He won't even remember.

12
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,766
Forget it.

13
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,895
He hasn't been here for 30 years.

14
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,273
You know what he's like.

15
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,486
He'll remember.

16
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:18,407
I'm sure he will.
I know him better than you do.

17
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,745
If he finds out we didn't tell him,
he'll be angry.

18
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:30,044
I'd like to talk to Signor Salvatore di Vita.
I'm his mother.

19
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,666
What the fuck are you looking at?

20
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,928
Salvatore... what time is it?

21
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,974
It's late.

22
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:14,440
Sorry, I couldn't phone
to say I'd be late.

23
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,944
Go back to sleep.

24
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,366
Your mother phoned.

25
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,995
She thought I was someone else.

26
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,248
What did you tell her?

27
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:36,503
Nothing, I didn't want to disappoint her.
We had a long chat.

28
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,300
She said you've not visited her
for 30 years.

29
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,927
She must come to see you.

30
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,056
She called just to say that?

31
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:57,816
No, she said someone's died.
Someone called Alfredo.

32
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,903
The funeral is tomorrow.

33
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,907
Who is he? A relative?

34
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:10,871
No... go back to sleep.

35
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,614
How can I say Mass with this boy?

36
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,422
Toto!

37
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,644
Thank God for that!

38
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,688
How do I have to tell you?

39
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,524
Without the bell,
I don't know where I am.

40
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,029
Always asleep!
What do you do at night? Eat?

41
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,408
Father Adelfio, at home
we don't even eat at lunchtime.

42
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,037
The vet says that's why I'm tired.

43
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,749
I'll tell you why you're tired.
Think I don't know?

44
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,169
Run along now,
I've something to do.

45
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,379
- Can I come with you?
- No, you can't.

46
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,342
Toto, go away!

47
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,397
Alfredo!

48
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,613
You can start.

49
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,336
Here we go again.

50
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,524
The frame!

51
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,453
THE LOWER DEPTHS

52
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,850
<i>One day, everything will be ours.</i>

53
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,437
<i>We'll go away together.</i>

54
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,565
<i>To live the good life...</i>

55
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,192
<i>... where no one knows us.</i>

56
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,945
<i>Stop dreaming.</i>

57
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,115
<i>You don't love me any more.</i>

58
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,035
<i>Why?</i>

59
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,845
<i>I'd have preferred a good word.</i>

60
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,931
<i>- I can't.
- Oh, well.</i>

61
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,583
100 lire! Pure nylon!

62
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,685
You mustn't come here.

63
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,979
How many times
do I have to tell you?

64
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,522
You're only little.

65
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:57,444
If there's a fire,
you'll go up in smoke.

66
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,489
"And turn into a piece of charcoal."

67
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,368
You've got a big mouth.

68
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,413
One of these days I'll cut it off.

69
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,334
Like that.

70
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,724
Can I have it?

71
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,894
Please can I have it?

72
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,898
Well, can I or not?

73
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,069
Are you deaf or something?

74
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,988
I have to splice it back
before I return the film.

75
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,075
You're such a pest!

76
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:51,331
Then why didn't you splice these
before you returned the films?

77
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,171
Well, sometimes I can't find
the right place, so they stay here.

78
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,215
They kiss too much, anyway.

79
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,929
- Then I can have these.
- Now you listen to me.

80
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,977
Let's make a deal,
before I kick you up the arse.

81
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:16,356
- All these are yours, a present.
- Thank you.

82
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,944
But first, you don't come here again.
Second, I keep them here. Get it?

83
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,823
OK, so we're agreed.
Now, scram!

84
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,421
What kind of deal is that?

85
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,757
If they're mine,
how come you keep them?

86
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,723
Don't come back
or I'll thrash you!

87
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,442
"Shoot first, think later.

88
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,989
"This is no job for weaklings,
cuckolds and traitors.

89
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,998
"Hey, you bastard!
Hands off that gold!

90
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,172
"Stay away from me,
you dirty swine...

91
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,009
"...or I'll smash your face in!"

92
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,031
If the war's over,
why doesn't Dad come back?

93
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,577
He'll come back, you'll see.
One of these days.

94
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:58,166
I don't remember him anymore.
Where is Russia?

95
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,005
It takes years to get there...
and years to come back.

96
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,259
Go to bed, Toto. It's late.

97
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,632
You can fool your mother,
but not me.

98
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:53,722
Get your piece of paper and join
the police, you little wretch!

99
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,607
Come on!

100
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,832
Well? How much is 5 x 5?

101
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,878
30.

102
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,681
Quiet! The five times table,
you dimwit!

103
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,850
1 x 5 ŪŪ 5.

104
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,686
2 x 5 ŪŪ 10.

105
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,397
3 x 5 ŪŪ 15.

106
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,150
4 x 5 ŪŪ 20.

107
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,694
5 x 5?

108
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,030
40.

109
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,501
Quiet! Quiet!

110
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,336
Boccia!

111
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,547
25.

112
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,930
For the last time...

113
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,475
- 5 x 5?
- Christmas!

114
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,185
I've a ticket,
I want to see the film.

115
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,438
Get down. You can't stay here.

116
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,649
Go back to your seat!

117
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,736
They're all over the place,
like rabbits.

118
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,751
<i>I must go to Oregon.
Wait for me at my ranch.</i>

119
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,838
<i>Wait for a dead man?</i>

120
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,508
<i>A star-studded cast</i>

121
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,262
<i>featuring John Wayne,
Claire Trevor...</i>

122
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,486
Good evening, everyone!
Can't I say hello?

123
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:59,949
- Double-bill today.
- So what? I come here to sleep.

124
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,209
Cut the news, Alfredo!

125
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,714
ITALY DOESN'T FORGET.
RESISTANCE RALLY.

126
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,092
Quiet! This is important.

127
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:23,723
<i>The men and women who fought
in the Resistance</i>

128
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,518
<i>are reunited in Rome
for the First Resistance Rally</i>

129
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:32,899
<i>organised by CVL.
Prime Minister Parri...</i>

130
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,500
Hello, everybody!

131
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,798
- Can we watch the film or what?
- You shut up, then.

132
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,717
THE EARTH TREMBLES -
EPISODE OF THE SEA

133
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,178
Featuring
SICILIAN FISHERMEN

134
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,948
What does it say?

135
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,451
- Who knows? I'm illiterate.
- You too?

136
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:35,044
The Italian language is not spoken
by the poor in Sicily.

137
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,464
<i>12 hours of blood and sweat</i>

138
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:43,636
<i>to take home the bare minimum
required not to die of hunger.</i>

139
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,265
<i>And yet, their nets</i>

140
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,977
<i>were full when they
pulled them up.</i>

141
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:55,690
<i>All day fishing, and what do
we have to show for it?</i>

142
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,525
<i>That may be so</i>

143
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,239
<i>but what can we do?</i>

144
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,894
I knew it!

145
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,483
20 years going to the cinema,
and I've never seen a kiss!

146
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,652
Will we ever?

147
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,075
Son of a bitch!

148
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,792
THE END

149
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,221
- You and you, to work.
- What about me, Don Vincenzo?

150
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,891
You? Get a job from Stalin.

151
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:58,729
Don't you worry,
his day will come.

152
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,231
I always get left out.

153
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,861
Nice film.
That young man worked ever so hard.

154
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,612
Pity he was so unlucky.

155
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,782
Why did he go and buy that boat?

156
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,827
Idiot!
You didn't understand anything.

157
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:19,584
Right, boys. Here you work
from dawn to dusk.

158
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,211
And no questions about pay.

159
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,618
I've been looking for you all day.
Did you buy the milk?

160
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,289
And the money?

161
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,458
Stolen.

162
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,420
You went to the cinema?

163
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,342
The cinema!

164
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:17,767
- Signora Maria, wait!
- Leave him alone, you're hurting him.

165
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:23,564
And you, why do you tell lies?
You know you got in free.

166
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,942
Go on, tell your mother.

167
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:29,820
Maybe he lost it inside.
How much?

168
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,531
50 lire.

169
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,827
What did you find under
the seats tonight?

170
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,959
A comb...

171
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,506
two heels...

172
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:52,843
a tobacco pouch...

173
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,262
And...

174
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,348
50 lire.

175
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,731
See?

176
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:10,778
Thank you, Alfredo.
Good night.

177
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,447
- Good morning.
- Good night.

178
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,666
I understood right away.

179
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,919
The square is mine!

180
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:37,013
It's midnight! Out!
I must close the square.

181
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:08,062
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

182
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,191
Going, it's downhill
and all the saints help you.

183
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:16,028
Coming back,
the saints just watch.

184
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,572
If it is God's will...

185
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,242
See you tonight.

186
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,375
What's wrong?
Your foot this time?

187
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,794
Always something.

188
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,589
Oh dear, what can we do?

189
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,680
Did you know my father, Alfredo?

190
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,516
Of course I knew him.

191
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:50,438
Tall, thin, good-tempered,
with a moustache like mine.

192
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,108
He always smiled.
He looked like Clark Gable.

193
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:58,988
Now I'm older, Alfredo,
and I'm in the fifth year,

194
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:05,119
I'm not asking to go into the booth,
but couldn't we at least be friends?

195
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:10,750
"I choose my friends for their looks,
and my enemies for their intelligence."

196
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,003
You're too clever to be my friend.

197
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,839
I always tell my children

198
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:20,176
to be careful how they
choose their friends.

199
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,845
But you don't have any children.

200
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,641
But when I do, I'll tell them.

201
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:36,942
Don't cry.
It's all right, I'm here.

202
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,653
The fire's out.

203
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,073
Mum, what happened?

204
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,992
You scoundrel!

205
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:50,498
Your sister could have burned
to death because of you!

206
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:54,418
You'll be the end of me!

207
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,964
I told you not to keep
your films near the fire.

208
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,884
You even burned my photos.

209
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:14,730
- You and your films!
- He was burning down the house.

210
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:24,114
Aren't you ashamed of playing
games with him at your age?

211
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,619
- What have I done?
- Who gave him the films?

212
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,749
You shouldn't give them to him,
he's mad!

213
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,545
All he talks about is you
and the cinema.

214
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,174
Swear you won't let him in again.

215
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,554
I give you my word.

216
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,936
May God send your father home,
he'll deal with you.

217
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:59,525
Dad is not coming back,
and I know why. He's dead.

218
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,027
No, it's not true!

219
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,699
He'll be back, you'll see.

220
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:43,402
<i>"And so the good and evil of men comes
and goes, and time is like a flowing river."</i>

221
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:51,869
THE END

222
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,509
They smoke like chimneys.

223
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,604
Go and buy a ticket!

224
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,130
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

225
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,730
Signora Anna!

226
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,964
Don't blame me, your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

227
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,883
- Give it to me.
- I told Mum

228
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,346
you didn't give me the film.
It wasn't your fault.

229
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,807
I thought you were joking
when you said

230
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,393
the film could catch fire.

231
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,563
I just wanted to tell you.
Now I'll go.

232
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,901
Toto... come here.

233
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,115
Come and sit down.

234
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,872
Now, listen.
I started this job when I was ten.

235
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,751
We didn't have these
modern machines then.

236
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,713
Films were silent.

237
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:11,925
You turned the projector by hand
with a crank.

238
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,428
All day long!

239
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,139
And it was hard,
this damned crank.

240
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:21,935
If you got tired,
and slowed down a bit...

241
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,607
everything was burned,
in a flash.

242
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:34,573
So why don't you teach me,
now there's no crank and it's easy?

243
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,326
Because I don't want to, Toto.

244
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,330
This is no job for you.

245
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:45,667
You work like a slave,
always alone.

246
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:49,296
You watch the same film 100 times.
Nothing else to do.

247
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,509
You end up talking to Greta Garbo
and Tyrone Power.

248
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:58,806
Always working.
Every holiday, Easter, Christmas...

249
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,184
You only get Good Friday off.

250
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:08,273
And if they hadn't put Christ on a cross,
we'd work even then.

251
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,193
So why don't you change jobs?

252
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,285
Because I'm stupid.

253
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:27,709
Who else around here would
be a projectionist? No one.

254
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,921
It takes an imbecile like me.

255
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,424
It's my luck.

256
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,137
When I was little,
there was the war.

257
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,850
When I grew up,
there was another war.

258
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:49,523
So, you want to be
a stick-in-the-mud like me?

259
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,696
Good boy.

260
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,448
It's for your own good.

261
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,908
Always stuck in here.

262
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,162
Boiling hot in summer,
freezing cold in winter.

263
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:07,833
Breathing in fumes,
and earning a pittance.

264
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,087
Is it all bad?

265
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,757
You get used to it.
And then, from up here

266
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,718
when the cinema is full,

267
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:22,848
you hear people laughing,
and that makes you happy.

268
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,017
It makes you feel good.

269
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,478
Like you're the one
who makes them laugh

270
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,649
and makes them forget
their troubles.

271
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,485
That, I like.

272
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,918
You didn't hear a word I said.
What are you up to?

273
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,922
I can't turn my back for a minute.

274
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:58,926
Your mother is right.
You're mad!

275
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:03,847
How on earth did he do it?
He watches and learns.

276
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,646
I'll tell the manager not to let you in.
Did you hear?

277
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,148
And I'll tell Father Adelfio.

278
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:17,402
No more altar boy,
you understand?

279
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,154
Alfredo!

280
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,073
Get stuffed!

281
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,377
I've won! I've won the pools!

282
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,346
Ciccio from Naples
has won the pools!

283
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,144
The Neapolitan has won the pools!
Come along, quick.

284
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,564
These Northerners have
all the luck!

285
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,476
The square is mine!

286
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:39,484
Keep still! Are the horse-flies
bothering you?

287
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,822
You've a louse factory up here.
Off you go.

288
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:03,342
What do you want?
Off you go.

289
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:17,647
A shopkeeper owns two shops.

290
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,361
In one, he sells fruit...

291
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,113
Be seated.

292
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:31,370
Here are the external candidates
for the School Certificate.

293
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,586
Quiet!

294
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,841
Quiet!

295
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,743
Rotten little stinker!

296
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,038
- Help me, Toto.
- Quiet!

297
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,959
- I haven't got a clue!
- Quiet!

298
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,709
<i>Francesco Messana.</i>

299
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,794
<i>In the name of the law,
you're under arrest.</i>

300
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,980
Son of a bitch! Pencil-pusher!

301
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,983
This is where it can catch fire.

302
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,902
If it does, you cut here and there

303
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,948
or the whole reel will burn.
Got it?

304
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:45,415
I won't stand for this sort of thing!

305
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,418
Which side is the gelatine on?

306
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,921
It tastes good.

307
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:06,144
These are the invoices.
Always keep them safe.

308
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,564
- Yes, Alfredo.
- Don't ever forget.

309
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,837
This is for you.
Today you can load the reels.

310
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,676
- It's so high up.
- Now you can do it alone.

311
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,303
Stay still.

312
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,101
What a woman!

313
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,939
Children, say goodbye to Peppino.
He's going to Germany.

314
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,701
Why won't you say goodbye
to your friend?

315
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:06,079
My father says he's a Communist.

316
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,248
God bless you, Mum.

317
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,793
- Will he find work in Germany?
- Who knows?

318
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,964
It's like an adventure.
You live in hope.

319
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,551
Screw this country!

320
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:24,222
Go and work in Germany,
you and your Stalin.

321
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,730
Goodbye, Peppino!
Come back soon.

322
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,450
At least Germany is closer
than Russia.

323
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,957
<i>After six years,
the return of spring fashion.</i>

324
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,460
<i>A fresh new look</i>

325
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,004
<i>unlike the pompous styles
of wartime.</i>

326
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,691
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

327
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,672
LOOKING FOR NEWS,
WRITE TO US

328
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:44,469
<i>Another sad page in the tragedy
of our men in Russia.</i>

329
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:50,058
<i>The Ministry of Defence has released
a new list of Italian dead</i>

330
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:53,019
<i>until now considered missing.</i>

331
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:57,941
<i>The names will be posted
by the military authorities.</i>

332
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:02,278
<i>All the families concerned
will be notified.</i>

333
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:10,203
Unfortunately, we don't know
where he's buried.

334
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,748
Here is the pension form
for you to sign.

335
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:58,585
<i>Hadn't I told you?
He's courting me.</i>

336
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,337
<i>Well, he's no oil painting...</i>

337
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,660
Go home, we can't have
another show.

338
00:49:55,785 --> 00:50:01,040
It's late, can't you understand?

339
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,461
Some people have seen it twice.

340
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,634
We've been waiting an hour.

341
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,351
Tomorrow we'll show another film.

342
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:24,397
A Western, I promise!
Go to bed.

343
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:31,779
Close the doors.
They'll wreck the Paradiso. Hell, even.

344
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,411
Alfredo, you let us in!

345
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,372
What do you want me to do?

346
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,834
We've been waiting for hours.

347
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,171
"The mob doesn't think.

348
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,132
"It has no mind of its own."

349
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,429
The great Spencer Tracy
said it in "Fury".

350
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,389
Well, what do you say?

351
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,269
Shall we let the poor devils
see the film?

352
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,191
I wish we could, but how?

353
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:14,989
"If you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see."

354
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:18,201
So, get your arse off that stool.

355
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,873
Pay attention.

356
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,090
Now we pass through these walls.

357
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,128
Look out of the window, kid.

358
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,385
It's beautiful, Alfredo!

359
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,931
Over there! Look, the cinema!

360
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,526
Thank you, Alfredo!

361
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,077
What on earth is going on?

362
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,998
It's the cinema.

363
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,335
Go to hell!

364
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,678
There's no sound, Alfredo.

365
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,513
Shall we keep them happy?

366
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,091
Want to go down?

367
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,612
- Come. Look at this.
- Oh, my God!

368
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:11,040
- Ah, Nunzio! Half price will do.
- As you wish.

369
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,678
You must buy tickets, folks.

370
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:28,975
Half price.

371
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,061
Get stuffed! The square
belongs to everyone.

372
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:38,985
The square is mine!
Don't joke about it, it makes me mad.

373
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,674
Run!

374
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:56,288
Oh, my God, what's happened?
I can't believe it.

375
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,161
Help!

376
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,709
Help!

377
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,432
Poor Alfredo. What a shame.

378
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,810
It's all burned down.

379
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,151
All burned down!

380
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,586
What do we do now?

381
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,840
No more entertainment
in the village, nothing.

382
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,843
How can we rebuild all this?

383
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:39,099
Look at Ciccio from Naples.
You'd hardly know him.

384
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:41,810
Who has that kind of money?

385
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,821
The New Cinema Paradiso!

386
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,486
This cinema is for you!

387
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:43,581
He's just a boy. What about
the child labour laws?

388
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:47,918
I got a licence through
my connections.

389
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,129
But don't ask me how it works.

390
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:54,091
Officially, I'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

391
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,096
Stay on your toes, Toto.
No falling asleep.

392
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,140
No more disasters.

393
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,393
Do as poor Alfredo taught you.

394
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,228
And God bless you, son.

395
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,273
Thank you, Father.

396
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:14,737
What's this? A funeral?
Life goes on. Music!

397
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,272
<i>You've fallen in love
with that peasant?</i>

398
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:34,858
<i>Maybe.</i>

399
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,072
<i>And he's asked you to marry him?</i>

400
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:47,955
<i>Then it's all over between us?</i>

401
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:56,922
What a dish!

402
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,699
My God, they're kissing!

403
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:31,123
I shall not watch pornographic films.

404
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,589
Bravo, Don Ciccio!

405
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,039
Any room for me
in this new paradise?

406
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:21,924
Bring him home afterwards, Toto.
I'm going now, Alfredo.

407
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:24,718
I'm so glad you're here.

408
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,516
How is school?

409
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:34,102
Fine, but now I'm working

410
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,188
maybe I won't go any more.

411
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:45,155
Don't do that, Toto.
You'll end up with egg on your face.

412
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,324
What does that mean?

413
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,618
It means...

414
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:55,666
that this is no job for you.

415
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,960
Now the Paradiso needs you

416
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:01,463
and you need the Paradiso.
But it won't last.

417
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:07,052
One day you'll move on
to other things.

418
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,888
Other things.

419
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,600
More important things.

420
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,352
Much more important.

421
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:22,359
I know. Now I've lost my sight...

422
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,319
I see better.

423
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,281
Things I never saw before.

424
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:32,870
Thanks to you, who saved my life,
I'll never forget.

425
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,373
Don't look so gloomy.

426
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,460
I'm not gaga yet. Want proof?

427
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:45,257
Let's see.
Right now, for instance...

428
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:50,637
the film is out of focus.
Check it.

429
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:59,521
You're right, it's out of focus.
How did you do?

430
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:03,400
It's difficult to explain.

431
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:17,748
Only two days? I don't give a shit
about other cinemas.

432
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:21,501
I'll be crucified if I can't show
the film for more than two days.

433
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:27,299
Even if we open at 8 in the morning,
we still can't do it.

434
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,801
It's a big place and you know it.

435
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:34,765
I could make life very difficult
for you by writing to Rome.

436
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:39,019
I'm warning you.
Don't mess with me or you'll regret it.

437
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,647
I have an idea, Don Ciccio.

438
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:45,067
Remember the old cinema
in the next village?

439
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:51,239
The projector's gone rusty
but I could easily fix it.

440
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:56,078
Get the cinema cleaned up,
hire a projectionist

441
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:58,246
and we show the film
in both places.

442
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:02,167
Don't be stupid.
You should know better, Toto.

443
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,545
I'm lucky that they send me
the one copy.

444
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:07,047
Imagine if I asked for two.

445
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:11,009
They'd chop my head off
and play ball with it.

446
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,930
- Who says we need two copies?
- You mean we don't?

447
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,969
<i>I swore on the Virgin Mary
to my son.</i>

448
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,723
We see a child asleep in her bed.

449
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,161
<i>Get something, hurry.</i>

450
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:26,251
"The lawyer told me.
Now I know."

451
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:29,421
<i>The lawyer told me.
Now I know.</i>

452
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:35,093
"Everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know."

453
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:36,928
<i>Everyone must know.</i>

454
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,933
"Do you... believe me?"

455
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,268
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

456
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,396
"Yes. I believe you."

457
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,816
<i>Yes. I believe you.</i>

458
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:01,286
"Our own home.
How I've dreamt of it!"

459
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,331
<i>- Our own home.
- How I've dreamt of it!</i>

460
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:12,881
"Tonino!"

461
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:17,010
<i>Tonino! Mamma! My son!</i>

462
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,576
The End.

463
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:45,622
THE END

464
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,381
I don't like it! I don't like it!

465
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,514
I cut the end credits
to go faster.

466
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:07,477
Bring me Part One,
while I show a newsreel

467
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:14,317
I'll call the police. Take him, he's
seen it ten times. One moment!

468
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,675
Here's Part One, Boccia.

469
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,137
Hurry!
The house is packed.

470
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:48,435
What are you doing?
Get the bloody thing rolling.

471
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,313
People are getting restless.

472
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:02,282
Bunch of animals! Shut up!

473
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,348
To hell with it!

474
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:36,900
When is it starting, Toto?
We've got work to do tomorrow.

475
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,781
Toto, what's going on?
They're furious.

476
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,991
It's been half an hour.

477
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,868
And what do you want me to do?

478
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:53,333
Where's that son of a bitch?
I'll be ruined.

479
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:06,429
I'll have you know I left my wife sick
in bed in order to watch this film.

480
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,723
And I still haven't seen a thing.

481
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:14,646
If it doesn't start in 10 minutes,
we want our money back.

482
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,190
Or I'll give you a taste
of my cane.

483
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,658
Calm down.
Can I say something?

484
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,786
I'll show you Part One again.

485
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:35,417
- We've seen Part One.
- We want to know how it ends.

486
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,671
Quiet!

487
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:43,800
I've already seen it.
I'll tell you how it ends.

488
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,500
Boccia, what's wrong?

489
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:27,260
- You idiot!
- This is good.

490
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,387
Go away! Go.

491
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:08,259
What are you doing?
Watch the screen, you pigs.

492
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:20,980
Behave yourself.

493
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,914
I told you, it doesn't catch fire.

494
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,129
Progress always comes too late.

495
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,799
SEVEN BRIDES
FOR SEVEN BROTHERS

496
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,384
AND SEVEN
UNFORGETTABLE SONGS

497
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,568
<i>Workers of the world...</i>

498
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:25,522
Go on, stick it in.

499
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,273
Don't be afraid.

500
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:30,318
Is it true that if I bleed I should
squeeze lemon on it?

501
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:37,492
Where did you get that from,
you silly boy?

502
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,539
Go on, stick it in. Don't worry.

503
01:15:43,665 --> 01:15:46,709
Like this, you see?

504
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:51,839
See? Nothing happens.
Good boy.

505
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,646
Now you're a man.

506
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:11,067
What am I saying? A young bull,
that's what you are.

507
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,613
She's new.

508
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:59,282
Not bad.

509
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,159
She's nice.

510
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:04,954
Her father's a bank manager,
a big shot.

511
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:08,708
Jerks it off with his shirt,
not to get his hands dirty.

512
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,506
Faster, faster.

513
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,761
Last one's a sissy.

514
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:33,524
Excuse me.

515
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,574
You dropped this.

516
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,452
Thanks. I hadn't noticed.

517
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:52,251
- I'm Salvatore. And you?
- Elena. My name is Elena.

518
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:57,674
I wanted to tell you the other day,
at the station...

519
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:06,557
Charles Chaplin's "Modern Times".
Right, Toto?

520
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:11,896
I know it by heart.

521
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:16,150
I showed it in 1940, on the Sunday
my first wife died.

522
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:20,822
They kept it from me all day so they
wouldn't have to close the cinema.

523
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:23,449
I only found out at the end.

524
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,704
It's stuck in my mind.

525
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,709
I'll never forget.

526
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,755
What is it? Is it your footage?

527
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,632
What do you see?

528
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:43,428
A young bull being slaughtered.

529
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:48,057
A big pool of blood
on the ground.

530
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,601
Another young bull steps
over the blood...

531
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,979
on its way to its death.

532
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:02,780
What do you see now?
Tell me.

533
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:06,242
Nothing, it's out of focus.

534
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:11,038
A woman.

535
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,625
It's a woman!

536
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,589
Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

537
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,008
What's she like?

538
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:24,135
She's very nice.

539
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:29,432
My age, slim,
with long brown hair.

540
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:33,686
She has big blue eyes
and a clear gaze.

541
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,147
A beauty spot on her lip.

542
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:39,150
Tiny one, you only see it close.

543
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,738
And when she smiles, you feel...
I don't know.

544
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,618
Love.

545
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,627
I know how it is, Toto.

546
01:19:57,752 --> 01:20:00,797
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

547
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:06,302
You can never get close to them,
whatever you do.

548
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:10,348
"The bigger the man,
the deeper the imprint.

549
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:15,853
"And when he's in love, he suffers
knowing it's a dead end."

550
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:19,607
It's nice what you say, but sad.

551
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,361
I didn't say it.

552
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,405
It was John Wayne in
"The Shepherd of the Hills".

553
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,408
You old sneak!

554
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:14,537
- Hello, Elena.
- Hi! Why are you running?

555
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:17,582
Because...

556
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,753
I wanted to tell you...

557
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,339
You remember when...?

558
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,677
Nice day, isn't it?

559
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:36,809
Yes, beautiful day.

560
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,398
Excuse me, I must go.
Bye, Salvatore.

561
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:50,615
What a jerk!

562
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,702
"Nice day, isn't it?"
How stupid!

563
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,423
You don't believe me.

564
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:09,842
But I'll be the man in your life.

565
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,970
I'm not Marlon Brando, I know.

566
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:17,099
But take a good look at me.
I'm not that bad, am I?

567
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:25,441
Shall I try again?
Maybe this time I'll succeed.

568
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,577
Please may I speak to Elena?

569
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,538
Is that you, Elena?

570
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:43,709
Sorry, I didn't recognise you.
I'm Salvatore, remember?

571
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:51,175
I know I sound like an idiot whenever
we meet, but I'm not like that.

572
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,471
I can't find the words to say it,
but I can't stop thinking about you.

573
01:22:57,390 --> 01:23:02,937
I think of you night and day.
I dream of you every night.

574
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:05,481
Sounds silly on the phone,
but I love you.

575
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,942
<i>Stop this,
or I'll call the police.</i>

576
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:11,654
- Who's that?
<i>- Elena's mother, you cretin.</i>

577
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:15,658
I'm sorry, madam.
I really didn't know...

578
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,160
Bloody hell!

579
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:23,332
I told you.
You thought I was kidding you.

580
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:28,879
Take it from me.
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

581
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:32,258
But why? There must be a way
to make her understand.

582
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:38,180
Forget it, Toto.
Feelings can never be understood.

583
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:43,352
- You can't explain them.
- Oh, you made the world!

584
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:48,607
Hey, don't get angry with me.
What's come over you?

585
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,861
Where are you?

586
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:55,197
- Out of the way. You mad?
- Toto, come here!

587
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:01,620
Can't see where I'm going.

588
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:15,801
How dare you talk to me like that?

589
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:18,679
With all due respect to the Lord,

590
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,390
who made the world in three days.

591
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:23,893
I'd have taken longer,

592
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:27,063
but certain things
I could have done better.

593
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:30,941
Like I said,
you have all the answers.

594
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:37,948
I'll tell you a story.
Just for you, Toto.

595
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:42,453
Let's sit down. God Almighty!

596
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:45,706
Once upon a time...

597
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:49,418
a king gave a feast.

598
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:53,214
The most beautiful princesses
were there.

599
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,384
A soldier who was standing guard

600
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:00,096
saw the king's daughter go by.

601
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:04,850
She was the loveliest one,
and he fell instantly in love.

602
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:11,607
But what is a simple soldier
next to the daughter of a king?

603
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:15,986
One day he managed to meet her

604
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:20,908
and told her he could no longer
live without her.

605
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:26,497
The princess was so taken
by the depth of his feeling

606
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,125
that she said to the soldier,

607
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:34,130
"If you can wait for 100 days

608
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:38,300
"and 100 nights under my balcony

609
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,344
"I shall be yours."

610
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:48,644
With that, the soldier went
and waited one day, two days

611
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:50,896
then ten, twenty.

612
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:56,318
Each evening the princess looked out,
and he never moved!

613
01:25:56,443 --> 01:26:00,281
Always there, come rain,
come thunder.

614
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:05,661
Birds shat on his head,
bees stung him, but he didn't budge.

615
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:12,168
After 90 nights...

616
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,380
he had become...

617
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,676
all dry and pale.

618
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:25,556
Tears streamed from his eyes.

619
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,725
He couldn't hold them back.

620
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:32,271
He didn't even have
the strength to sleep.

621
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,984
And all that time,
the princess watched him.

622
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:42,198
When the 99th night came

623
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:45,367
the soldier stood up,

624
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:48,829
took his chair, and left.

625
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,956
How come? Right at the end?

626
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,835
Right at the end, Toto.

627
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:58,339
Don't ask me what it means,
I don't know.

628
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:03,677
If you can figure it out,
you tell me.

629
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,531
Please, don't ask me why.

630
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:31,265
What is it, Alfredo? Not now,
I must administer the sacrament.

631
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,144
Father Adelfio,
I need you urgently.

632
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:40,107
I have terrible doubts
tormenting my soul.

633
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,242
- Father, I have sinned.
- Do that later.

634
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,704
Please, don't turn around.

635
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:57,458
- Just act normal. It's Salvatore.
- How did you get in here?

636
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:06,050
- That's a terrible thing to say.
- I know.

637
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:10,346
Take the miracle of
the loaves and fishes.

638
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:15,976
I've often wondered.
How is it possible?

639
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:22,483
It's terrible. Mum told Dad.
How could you mistake her voice?

640
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:24,860
Sorry, Elena, I was stupid.

641
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:27,654
But I had to talk to you.

642
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,916
You're beautiful, Elena.

643
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:40,751
That's what I wanted to say.

644
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:45,214
I can never find the words
when I see you.

645
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:48,467
I get the shivers.

646
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:52,971
I don't know how other people do it.

647
01:29:53,097 --> 01:29:55,349
It's my first time.

648
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,561
But I'm in love with you.

649
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:01,688
Father, I have sinned.

650
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:03,607
I absolve you from your sins

651
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:07,611
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

652
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,369
You're even prettier
when you laugh.

653
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:27,506
You're very sweet,
and I like you.

654
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,925
But I'm not in love with you.

655
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:37,975
- It's OK. I'll wait.
- For what?

656
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:42,271
For you to love me.
Listen to me.

657
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,817
Every night, after work

658
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:50,279
I'll wait outside your house.
Every night.

659
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:57,119
When you change your mind,
open your window. I'll understand.

660
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:58,537
You understand now?

661
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:03,750
Yes... finally, I see the light.

662
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:11,383
Next time, don't talk heresy.

663
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,343
You survived the fire
in the cinema.

664
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:17,973
But from the eternal fire,
no one can save you.

665
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,524
What's Toto doing?

666
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:54,403
The cinema is closed at this hour.

667
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:13,505
Attention, please!

668
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,759
15 seconds to the New Year!

669
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:22,848
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve,

670
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:27,477
eleven, ten, nine, eight,

671
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:32,482
seven, six, five, four,

672
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:35,986
three, two, one!

673
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:40,949
Don't worry, he must be
with his friends.

674
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:44,620
- Cheers!
- Happy New Year!

675
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:50,125
Happy New Year.

676
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,711
Let's drink to Toto.

677
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,309
Turn the lights on, Toto!

678
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:01,274
Look, the car's still running in.

679
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:08,657
How will we get home?

680
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,327
Stop!

681
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:16,039
Oh, my God! It's my father.

682
01:37:18,667 --> 01:37:20,001
Good evening.

683
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:36,560
<i>Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.</i>

684
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:42,107
<i>From Milan, we present
"Double or Quit".</i>

685
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:44,150
<i>With Mike Bongiorno.</i>

686
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:54,244
<i>I've forgotten what I had to say...</i>

687
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:56,663
You pulling my leg?

688
01:37:56,788 --> 01:37:59,541
How can you watch TV
without a film?

689
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:02,294
You just can, Alfredo.

690
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:06,882
You can even buy a TV set
and watch it at home.

691
01:38:07,007 --> 01:38:11,761
This may be so, but I don't like it.
I can smell a rat.

692
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:14,306
<i>- From Massa...
- Macinaia.</i>

693
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:18,143
<i>I guess it's a village
near Massa Carrara?</i>

694
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:20,103
<i>No, it's near Lucca...</i>

695
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:23,940
Great idea, don't you think?

696
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:29,404
Couldn't have bought the equipment
without a loan from your bank.

697
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:32,282
Times have changed.

698
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:35,744
It's a new machine.
A teleprojector.

699
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:43,835
<i>- So, you are a landowner.
- Yes, I am.</i>

700
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,296
<i>What's your area of expertise?</i>

701
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:50,091
<i>- "The Divine Comedy".
- Very well.</i>

702
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:55,972
Maybe your father doesn't like
what I do. He thinks I'm poor.

703
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,479
We're going to Tuscany
in the summer.

704
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,566
If you came,
we could meet in secret.

705
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,695
I'm working at the outdoor cinema.
I'll miss you.

706
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:14,115
Don't be sad.
I'll write every day.

707
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:17,702
I'll be back at the end
of summer.

708
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:45,522
Outdoor cinema tonight
at the Imperia.

709
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:49,734
<i>Last one's a sissy!</i>

710
01:39:57,242 --> 01:39:59,244
Standing room only!

711
01:39:59,828 --> 01:40:02,956
You get in free and pay to leave.

712
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:16,511
Come on in, the show's just started.
Have your tickets ready.

713
01:40:48,752 --> 01:40:52,255
<i>Salvatore, my love.
The days are never-ending here.</i>

714
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:57,969
<i>I see your name everywhere,
in books, crosswords, newspapers.</i>

715
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:00,263
<i>You're always before my eyes.</i>

716
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:02,724
<i>Sadly, I have bad news.</i>

717
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:06,352
<i>We're moving to Palermo,
because of university.</i>

718
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:10,273
<i>It'll be difficult to see each other,
but don't worry.</i>

719
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:14,569
<i>I'll come and see you
at the Paradiso.</i>

720
01:41:20,325 --> 01:41:24,370
<i>If only I'd have known, I'd have
changed my pants this morning.</i>

721
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,372
<i>- Are you ready?
- Of course.</i>

722
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:30,627
<i>I knew she was easy.</i>

723
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:35,590
<i>- Guys, who's going to help me out?
- Coming!</i>

724
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:48,853
Hey, I caught an octopus!

725
01:42:06,955 --> 01:42:12,752
Post for di Vita.
Every blessed day. Here!

726
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,089
Hey, don't mess around.

727
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,456
<i>Remember us and the wine
we produced in your cave!</i>

728
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:54,961
<i>- Ulysses, he'll know where we are.
- Stop it, don't be scared.</i>

729
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,462
<i>Who is the boss now?</i>

730
01:42:56,588 --> 01:43:00,175
<i>God with His might,
or man with his wit?</i>

731
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:30,997
When will this bloody summer end?

732
01:43:32,207 --> 01:43:34,584
In a film, it'd already be over.

733
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:38,671
Cut, and there's a storm.
Great!

734
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:55,521
<i>Tell them I'm Ulysses!</i>

735
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:09,827
Elena! But when...?

736
01:44:09,953 --> 01:44:14,749
Today. You can't imagine
the excuses I made up.

737
01:44:47,657 --> 01:44:50,785
Sophia Loren is always
Sophia Loren.

738
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:54,247
Long legs and great boobs.

739
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:57,875
- Like Lana Turner.
- More beautiful.

740
01:44:58,001 --> 01:45:02,922
- For Toto. You give it to him.
- What is it?

741
01:45:04,549 --> 01:45:08,636
The devil take me!
What will I do now?

742
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:14,976
What did they say?

743
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:19,105
That as a war orphan,
I'm exempt from military service.

744
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,400
But nothing doing -
clerical error.

745
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:28,156
Must go to Rome on Friday.
They say I'll be discharged in ten days.

746
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:34,454
- You should go. My father's here.
- Good, I'll talk to him.

747
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:36,289
This time I'll convince him.

748
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:40,126
No, Salvatore.
He has other plans for me.

749
01:45:41,753 --> 01:45:43,087
Who?

750
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:45,340
The son of a colleague of his.

751
01:45:45,465 --> 01:45:49,719
We'll talk about it on Thursday.
Wait for me at the Paradiso.

752
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:52,680
I'll get the 5 o'clock bus.
I love you.

753
01:46:32,095 --> 01:46:34,806
It's a good film, Toto.

754
01:46:34,931 --> 01:46:37,558
But people here don't understand it.

755
01:46:37,683 --> 01:46:42,271
Tonight, load tomorrow's reels,
ready for the new man.

756
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:49,487
Hey, cheer up!
I'll wait for you, don't worry.

757
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:51,489
No one's taking your job.

758
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:54,700
It'll be waiting for you.
Don't look so gloomy.

759
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:01,559
You were expecting someone else?

760
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:05,521
No, Alfredo.
I came down to help you.

761
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:07,982
No, you were waiting for her.

762
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:13,529
Not nice waiting alone.
I'll keep you company.

763
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:17,074
Maybe you'd rather I went.

764
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,120
No, don't go.
In fact, I need your help.

765
01:48:46,187 --> 01:48:48,856
I can't hear this.

766
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:16,801
Open up!

767
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:35,861
Open up! Elena!

768
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:54,505
THE END

769
01:50:00,595 --> 01:50:01,887
I like it!

770
01:50:23,659 --> 01:50:24,910
I'm here.

771
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:29,332
Where were you?
Where did you go?

772
01:50:29,457 --> 01:50:33,419
Calm down. Here, sit down.

773
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:39,383
Did she come?

774
01:50:40,176 --> 01:50:42,511
No one came.

775
01:51:02,782 --> 01:51:06,494
Salvatore di Vita reporting for duty.

776
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:15,836
I wish to know when
I'll be discharged, sir.

777
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:19,382
No news as yet. Dismissed.

778
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:31,477
Her father's been transferred
and no one knows where to?

779
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:34,980
Sod you, bastard! You won't
bloody well tell me, will you?

780
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:47,326
NOT KNOWN AT THIS ADDRESS

781
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:01,924
I should have done ten days
and it's been a year, sir.

782
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:04,093
Without a day's leave.

783
01:52:28,951 --> 01:52:32,288
Di Vita, you've been discharged.

784
01:54:11,303 --> 01:54:13,848
You've lost weight.

785
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:16,267
They didn't treat you
very well, did they?

786
01:54:16,392 --> 01:54:21,897
They say you never go out
or talk to anyone. Why?

787
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:25,192
You know how it is.

788
01:54:26,527 --> 01:54:29,405
Sooner or later, the time comes

789
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:34,285
when it makes no difference
whether you talk or not.

790
01:54:36,579 --> 01:54:38,998
So you might as well shut up.

791
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:47,381
It's hot in here.

792
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:50,968
Take me to the sea.

793
01:54:51,093 --> 01:54:54,763
At Christmas, this lieutenant
pinches a girl's bum.

794
01:54:54,889 --> 01:54:58,601
She turns round.
It's the colonel's daughter.

795
01:54:58,726 --> 01:55:00,311
Terrified, he says,

796
01:55:00,436 --> 01:55:05,065
"If your heart is as hard as what
I've just felt, I'm a dead man."

797
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:13,616
Have you seen her?

798
01:55:17,328 --> 01:55:19,121
No one knows where she is.

799
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:24,919
It was probably meant
to be like this.

800
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:30,132
Each of us has a star to follow.

801
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:34,386
And now... what are you
planning to do?

802
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:46,857
Listen to this one.

803
01:55:46,982 --> 01:55:49,526
The commander says
to the sergeant,

804
01:55:49,652 --> 01:55:53,948
"Remember when there was
a windmill there?"

805
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:58,243
"Yes, sir. I remember.

806
01:55:58,369 --> 01:56:02,915
"The windmill's gone,
but the wind's still there."

807
01:56:11,924 --> 01:56:15,970
Remember the story about
the soldier and the princess?

808
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:31,026
Now I understand why the soldier left
right at the end.

809
01:56:36,365 --> 01:56:39,994
One more night and the princess
would have been his.

810
01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:43,664
But she might not have
kept her promise.

811
01:56:43,789 --> 01:56:47,626
That would have been too cruel.
It would have killed him.

812
01:56:48,711 --> 01:56:55,009
This way, at least, for 99 nights
he lived in hope that she'd be his.

813
01:56:56,969 --> 01:57:00,556
Do as the soldier, Toto.
Go away from here.

814
01:57:01,849 --> 01:57:03,892
This land is cursed.

815
01:57:04,893 --> 01:57:10,024
Living here every day,
you think it's the centre of the world.

816
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:14,945
That nothing will ever change.

817
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:18,157
Then you leave, for a year or two.

818
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:21,410
And when you return
everything's changed.

819
01:57:21,535 --> 01:57:23,412
The thread is broken.

820
01:57:24,538 --> 01:57:28,751
You don't find what you were looking for.
What was yours is gone.

821
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:35,299
You need to go away for a long time,
for many years

822
01:57:35,424 --> 01:57:39,136
before you can come back
and find your people...

823
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:43,474
the land where you were born.

824
01:57:44,308 --> 01:57:46,268
But not now. It's impossible.

825
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:49,438
Now you're blinder than I am.

826
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:53,275
Who said that? Gary Cooper?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

827
01:57:54,318 --> 01:57:56,278
No, Toto.

828
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:00,407
No one said it.

829
01:58:01,867 --> 01:58:03,744
This time, I'm saying it.

830
01:58:05,245 --> 01:58:09,208
Life is not what you see
in films.

831
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:12,961
Life is much harder.

832
01:58:15,172 --> 01:58:17,132
Go away!

833
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:20,636
Go back to Rome. You're young.

834
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:22,554
The world's your oyster.

835
01:58:23,931 --> 01:58:25,557
I'm old.

836
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,894
I don't want to hear you
any more.

837
01:58:29,978 --> 01:58:32,356
I want to hear about you.

838
02:00:04,865 --> 02:00:06,700
Don't come back.

839
02:00:07,951 --> 02:00:11,872
Don't think about us.
Don't look back, don't write.

840
02:00:13,081 --> 02:00:16,919
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget about us.

841
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:22,090
If you come back,
don't come and see me.

842
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:25,761
I won't let you in,
you understand?

843
02:00:32,976 --> 02:00:34,937
Thank you...

844
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:37,898
for everything you've done.

845
02:00:40,651 --> 02:00:43,737
Whatever you end up doing,
love it.

846
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:47,991
The way you loved
the projection booth

847
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:51,578
when you were a little boy.

848
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:04,633
Is he already gone?
Toto, farewell!

849
02:01:11,348 --> 02:01:13,350
I'm too late, what a pity!

850
02:02:13,535 --> 02:02:16,163
It's Toto. I knew it.

851
02:02:48,236 --> 02:02:53,241
Your sister Lia will be so happy
to see you. And the children.

852
02:02:53,367 --> 02:02:56,578
You won't recognise them.

853
02:02:56,703 --> 02:02:58,747
When are they coming to Rome?

854
02:02:58,872 --> 02:03:01,583
See how nice the house is?

855
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:05,379
We've had it all redone,
thanks to you.

856
02:03:05,504 --> 02:03:09,132
Come, I've a surprise for you.

857
02:03:11,009 --> 02:03:13,303
Are you tired?

858
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:16,348
You've time to rest
before the funeral.

859
02:03:16,473 --> 02:03:19,101
No, Mum.
The flight is only an hour.

860
02:03:20,394 --> 02:03:24,064
Don't say that,
after all these years.

861
02:03:24,189 --> 02:03:27,859
Come, I've put all your things
in here.

862
02:05:15,717 --> 02:05:18,887
He must be glad you came, Toto.

863
02:05:20,722 --> 02:05:23,850
He always talked about you,
always.

864
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:27,020
Right up to the end.

865
02:05:33,235 --> 02:05:35,487
He really loved you.

866
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:51,419
He left something for you.

867
02:05:52,879 --> 02:05:55,131
Before you leave

868
02:05:55,257 --> 02:05:57,050
come and see me.

869
02:07:42,489 --> 02:07:45,283
When did you close it down?

870
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:48,703
Six years ago in May.
No one ever came.

871
02:07:49,954 --> 02:07:54,918
You know it better than I do.
The recession, TV, videos...

872
02:07:55,752 --> 02:07:58,630
The cinema has become a memory.

873
02:08:00,173 --> 02:08:04,386
The city has purchased the site
for a public car park.

874
02:08:04,511 --> 02:08:08,390
They're pulling down on Saturday,
Signor di Vita. Pity!

875
02:08:10,392 --> 02:08:12,102
Why "Signor di Vita?"

876
02:08:13,561 --> 02:08:15,480
It didn't use to be like that.

877
02:08:15,605 --> 02:08:20,360
It's awkward to be casual
with an important person.

878
02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:24,030
However, if you insist... Toto.

879
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,743
Excuse me.

880
02:08:34,082 --> 02:08:36,751
Who would have believed it?
Toto.

881
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:13,621
Uncle, next time grandma goes
to Rome, I'll go with her.

882
02:09:13,747 --> 02:09:16,166
I want to see where you work.

883
02:09:16,291 --> 02:09:19,294
OK, but there's not much to see.

884
02:09:19,419 --> 02:09:22,088
My job is much ado about nothing.

885
02:09:24,257 --> 02:09:27,886
Careful, Salvatore.

886
02:09:28,011 --> 02:09:31,181
They're worse than cannibals,
they'll take advantage of you.

887
02:09:33,933 --> 02:09:35,268
Are you off tomorrow?

888
02:09:39,564 --> 02:09:43,067
I don't know.
I really don't know, Filippo.

889
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:05,089
Must be for you.

890
02:10:05,715 --> 02:10:10,261
They've been ringing all day
asking when you'll be back.

891
02:13:30,670 --> 02:13:32,588
Double whisky, please.

892
02:13:43,016 --> 02:13:48,271
Excuse me, aren't you Dr Lénera?
I'm a fan of yours.

893
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,445
Thank you.

894
02:15:10,478 --> 02:15:13,689
I'm so sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

895
02:16:35,855 --> 02:16:37,648
It's always me ringing.

896
02:16:37,773 --> 02:16:41,611
I asked you to pick me up
at lunchtime.

897
02:16:41,736 --> 02:16:44,655
Forget it, I'm not going.

898
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:47,575
In fact, I'll go on my own.

899
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:37,333
What are you thinking, Toto?

900
02:17:40,795 --> 02:17:44,840
We've never really talked, Mum.

901
02:17:48,469 --> 02:17:51,681
When I was little, I saw you...

902
02:17:53,474 --> 02:17:55,476
as an old woman already.

903
02:17:56,852 --> 02:17:59,105
Maybe all kids are like that,
who knows?

904
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:11,409
It's taken me all this time...

905
02:18:13,286 --> 02:18:17,415
to realise that you were young then,
and beautiful.

906
02:18:19,125 --> 02:18:21,377
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

907
02:18:23,379 --> 02:18:27,758
Why, then?
Why did you stay on your own?

908
02:18:28,843 --> 02:18:31,137
Without anyone to look after you.

909
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:36,517
You could have remarried.
Why didn't you?

910
02:18:39,895 --> 02:18:42,565
I might not have understood
at the time.

911
02:18:44,025 --> 02:18:46,485
But later... yes.

912
02:18:48,279 --> 02:18:51,240
There was never anyone, if that's
what you're thinking.

913
02:18:52,325 --> 02:18:54,452
I didn't want to.

914
02:18:54,577 --> 02:18:57,747
I remained faithful,
first to your father

915
02:18:57,872 --> 02:19:00,958
and then to you and Lia.

916
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:04,754
It's the way I am, what can I do?

917
02:19:04,879 --> 02:19:06,756
And you're like me.

918
02:19:08,007 --> 02:19:11,385
You're too attached to the past.

919
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:14,889
I'm not sure it's a good thing.

920
02:19:15,014 --> 02:19:19,018
Being faithful has its drawbacks.

921
02:19:19,143 --> 02:19:22,104
Fidelity brings loneliness.

922
02:19:29,695 --> 02:19:31,364
I shouldn't have called you.

923
02:19:33,741 --> 02:19:36,035
It's not your fault, Mum.

924
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:38,454
I've always been afraid
to come back.

925
02:19:42,166 --> 02:19:44,502
Now, after all these years...

926
02:19:45,711 --> 02:19:50,132
I thought I was stronger
and had forgotten many things.

927
02:19:52,176 --> 02:19:56,889
But it's all right there
in front of me...

928
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:00,184
as if I'd never gone away.

929
02:20:02,436 --> 02:20:05,272
And yet, I hardly know Lia.

930
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:11,320
And you, Mum...

931
02:20:12,571 --> 02:20:14,573
I deserted you.

932
02:20:15,783 --> 02:20:17,827
I ran away like a criminal.

933
02:20:17,952 --> 02:20:19,829
Without an explanation.

934
02:20:19,954 --> 02:20:24,125
I never asked for one.
You don't have to explain.

935
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:27,795
I always thought you were doing
the right thing.

936
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:30,214
Don't dwell on it.

937
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:32,842
Only one thing bothered me.

938
02:20:32,967 --> 02:20:37,638
At night, before I went to bed,

939
02:20:37,763 --> 02:20:39,265
I'd lock the door.

940
02:20:40,933 --> 02:20:43,269
- You never used to.
- I know.

941
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:48,315
When you worked in the cinema,
late at night,

942
02:20:48,441 --> 02:20:53,487
I could never sleep
till you got home.

943
02:20:54,905 --> 02:20:57,908
Then, when you got back,

944
02:20:58,033 --> 02:21:00,786
I pretended to be asleep.

945
02:21:00,911 --> 02:21:03,456
But I was aware
of all your movements.

946
02:21:03,581 --> 02:21:08,085
Then, when you were asleep,
I'd get up

947
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:10,838
and lock the door.

948
02:21:12,756 --> 02:21:16,427
After you'd gone...

949
02:21:17,261 --> 02:21:19,805
whenever I did that

950
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:23,267
I felt as though I was
locking someone out.

951
02:21:24,768 --> 02:21:26,604
Shutting him off.

952
02:21:27,855 --> 02:21:30,191
You were right to leave.

953
02:21:30,316 --> 02:21:32,860
It allowed you to do
what you wanted.

954
02:21:35,279 --> 02:21:39,742
When I phone you,
it's a different woman every time.

955
02:21:39,867 --> 02:21:42,495
I pretend that I know them

956
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:47,041
to avoid embarrassing introductions.

957
02:21:47,166 --> 02:21:51,212
I bet they take me
for a dotty old woman.

958
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:59,512
But I haven't yet heard the voice
of someone who really loves you.

959
02:21:59,637 --> 02:22:02,515
I can tell, you know.

960
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:07,686
All the same,
I'd like to see you settling down.

961
02:22:08,646 --> 02:22:10,356
In love with someone.

962
02:22:11,941 --> 02:22:14,318
But your life is there.

963
02:22:14,443 --> 02:22:16,487
Here, there are only ghosts.

964
02:22:17,446 --> 02:22:18,906
Let go, Toto.

965
02:23:23,095 --> 02:23:24,805
Boccia!

966
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:33,689
His name was Lo Meo.

967
02:24:33,499 --> 02:24:35,668
<i>Hello! Who is it?</i>

968
02:24:39,171 --> 02:24:42,591
- May I speak to Signora Elena?
<i>- Speaking.</i>

969
02:24:44,468 --> 02:24:46,136
<i>Who is it?</i>

970
02:24:48,222 --> 02:24:49,848
Salvatore.

971
02:24:57,064 --> 02:24:58,565
<i>Who?</i>

972
02:25:00,234 --> 02:25:03,779
Di Vita. I'm Salvatore di Vita.

973
02:25:06,532 --> 02:25:08,701
Remember me?

974
02:25:09,201 --> 02:25:14,206
I'm ringing from the bar
across the road, Elena.

975
02:25:26,427 --> 02:25:28,554
<i>Of course I remember you.</i>

976
02:25:32,599 --> 02:25:36,562
I'd like to see you, Elena.
Let's meet.

977
02:25:38,439 --> 02:25:40,190
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

978
02:25:41,108 --> 02:25:43,110
<i>Why should we meet?</i>

979
02:25:44,403 --> 02:25:46,321
<i>What good would it do?</i>

980
02:25:47,114 --> 02:25:48,907
Please, don't say no.

981
02:25:50,117 --> 02:25:54,121
<i>I'm old, Salvatore.
And so are you.</i>

982
02:25:54,246 --> 02:25:56,081
<i>It's best not to see each other.</i>

983
02:28:07,838 --> 02:28:09,423
How did you know I'd be here?

984
02:28:11,466 --> 02:28:15,178
It's been a long time, but I haven't
forgotten certain things.

985
02:28:16,597 --> 02:28:19,433
There aren't many places
you'd go to.

986
02:28:22,311 --> 02:28:23,896
I did the rounds.

987
02:28:42,915 --> 02:28:44,666
You're still beautiful.

988
02:28:48,712 --> 02:28:52,215
What are you saying? I'm old.

989
02:28:57,346 --> 02:28:59,348
Don't look at me like that.

990
02:29:03,435 --> 02:29:05,270
Why have you come back?

991
02:29:07,147 --> 02:29:11,109
Alfredo's dead.
Remember him?

992
02:29:12,778 --> 02:29:16,782
Of course I remember him.
I'm sorry.

993
02:29:20,077 --> 02:29:21,954
You were very fond of him.

994
02:29:24,790 --> 02:29:26,416
I saw your daughter.

995
02:29:27,751 --> 02:29:29,461
She's very beautiful.

996
02:29:32,005 --> 02:29:34,174
God knows how many Salvatores
she's got in tow.

997
02:29:36,468 --> 02:29:38,095
A few.

998
02:29:39,554 --> 02:29:42,474
But there are not many Salvatores.

999
02:29:46,395 --> 02:29:49,523
I've a son, too. He's older.

1000
02:29:52,484 --> 02:29:53,527
And you?

1001
02:29:53,652 --> 02:29:56,488
No children. I never married.

1002
02:30:01,201 --> 02:30:02,911
You happy?

1003
02:30:03,036 --> 02:30:04,913
I am, all things considered.

1004
02:30:07,249 --> 02:30:09,751
Though it's not what I dreamt of.

1005
02:30:13,338 --> 02:30:15,590
You know my husband, don't you?

1006
02:30:18,677 --> 02:30:21,096
Boccia, I remember him well.

1007
02:30:23,348 --> 02:30:26,768
What does he do?
What's his job?

1008
02:30:28,353 --> 02:30:32,733
He's a politician.
A local councillor.

1009
02:30:35,485 --> 02:30:38,196
We met again at Pisa University.

1010
02:30:41,241 --> 02:30:44,411
How come you didn't marry
your father's...?

1011
02:30:44,536 --> 02:30:48,165
I didn't want to.
I got my own way in the end.

1012
02:30:54,087 --> 02:30:56,882
I was still waiting for you
at the time.

1013
02:31:02,846 --> 02:31:06,808
I never forgot you.
Never.

1014
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:09,019
Neither did I.

1015
02:31:11,063 --> 02:31:13,356
Even though you'd disappeared.

1016
02:31:17,944 --> 02:31:19,988
But why talk about it now?

1017
02:31:26,161 --> 02:31:31,792
It's pathetic, and absurd.
You still live in Rome?

1018
02:31:31,917 --> 02:31:33,877
What are you saying?

1019
02:31:34,628 --> 02:31:37,964
We'd arranged to meet
at the Paradiso.

1020
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:42,177
But you never showed up.
Not a word, nothing.

1021
02:31:42,969 --> 02:31:45,972
How long ago was it?
Over 30 years.

1022
02:31:50,936 --> 02:31:52,854
But I...

1023
02:31:52,979 --> 02:31:55,107
I did show up.

1024
02:32:03,949 --> 02:32:05,992
But I was late.

1025
02:32:08,036 --> 02:32:10,622
I'd quarrelled with my parents.

1026
02:32:13,125 --> 02:32:17,129
Trying to convince them
not to come between us.

1027
02:32:18,964 --> 02:32:21,049
But it was no use.

1028
02:32:23,468 --> 02:32:29,516
They'd made up their minds
to leave Sicily once and for all.

1029
02:32:31,852 --> 02:32:33,895
And that's what we did.

1030
02:32:35,313 --> 02:32:38,984
I didn't know what do,
what to say.

1031
02:32:41,319 --> 02:32:46,116
So I agreed to do what
they wanted.

1032
02:32:48,910 --> 02:32:54,207
But I convinced my father to let me
see you one last time.

1033
02:32:56,168 --> 02:32:58,003
I was hoping...

1034
02:32:59,171 --> 02:33:04,092
we'd take a decision
when we met.

1035
02:33:05,927 --> 02:33:08,013
I thought maybe...

1036
02:33:09,848 --> 02:33:11,975
we'd run away together.

1037
02:33:18,231 --> 02:33:23,445
My father took me to the cinema.
But Alfredo was there, not you.

1038
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:30,243
And I couldn't wait
for you to come back.

1039
02:33:32,954 --> 02:33:34,456
Hurry up, Elena.

1040
02:33:34,581 --> 02:33:37,792
I told Alfredo what was happening.

1041
02:33:37,918 --> 02:33:42,464
I said we were going away
and asked him to let you know.

1042
02:33:45,717 --> 02:33:47,594
He was very nice to me.

1043
02:33:48,678 --> 02:33:52,265
He listened to me patiently.

1044
02:33:54,601 --> 02:33:58,355
Calm down, don't get upset.

1045
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:02,776
Listen to what I have to say.

1046
02:34:02,901 --> 02:34:07,072
If you want me to tell Toto,
I will.

1047
02:34:08,031 --> 02:34:12,577
But if you want my advice,
let it be.

1048
02:34:12,702 --> 02:34:15,163
It's best for you two
to stay apart.

1049
02:34:16,665 --> 02:34:18,416
My dear child...

1050
02:34:20,335 --> 02:34:23,129
Out of the fire of love
come ashes.

1051
02:34:23,255 --> 02:34:27,008
Even the greatest love
eventually fizzles out.

1052
02:34:27,133 --> 02:34:31,554
You'll meet other people,
plenty of them.

1053
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:34,474
But there's only one future
for Toto.

1054
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:39,521
He doesn't know it yet,
and wouldn't believe me if I told him.

1055
02:34:39,646 --> 02:34:42,023
He'd kill me if I did.

1056
02:34:43,817 --> 02:34:47,988
But you, my dear...
you can understand.

1057
02:34:48,113 --> 02:34:51,741
You must understand.
Do it for him.

1058
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:14,055
I never wanted anyone to know
my secret, not even you.

1059
02:35:21,980 --> 02:35:23,815
Bloody Alfredo!

1060
02:35:26,609 --> 02:35:28,737
He charmed everyone, even you.

1061
02:35:31,072 --> 02:35:33,700
I said I'd follow his advice.

1062
02:35:33,825 --> 02:35:36,411
But I left a note for you
before I left.

1063
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:50,175
I was on my way down.

1064
02:35:52,344 --> 02:35:55,347
I knew Alfredo couldn't see me.

1065
02:35:57,432 --> 02:35:59,309
So I went back up.

1066
02:36:01,811 --> 02:36:05,523
I saw him sitting there,
by the projector.

1067
02:36:07,484 --> 02:36:10,195
I took one of those bits of paper
on the wall.

1068
02:36:12,405 --> 02:36:14,866
And wrote a note saying
where to find me.

1069
02:36:17,535 --> 02:36:19,537
And that I'd wait for you.

1070
02:36:23,958 --> 02:36:26,336
But you disappeared all the same.

1071
02:36:37,138 --> 02:36:39,766
If you knew how I searched
for you.

1072
02:36:42,477 --> 02:36:44,229
You can't imagine.

1073
02:36:45,897 --> 02:36:48,191
I wrote, I phoned... nothing.

1074
02:36:50,777 --> 02:36:52,654
No one ever replied.

1075
02:36:57,158 --> 02:36:59,077
That's why I left...

1076
02:37:03,248 --> 02:37:05,750
and never came back.

1077
02:37:08,128 --> 02:37:10,171
But for years I dreamt of you.

1078
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:24,727
Time went by.

1079
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:30,859
Yet I looked for you in
every woman I ever met.

1080
02:37:32,652 --> 02:37:36,990
I was lucky in my career.
Very lucky, it's true.

1081
02:37:40,952 --> 02:37:43,621
But something was missing.

1082
02:37:46,749 --> 02:37:53,006
I could never have imagined
it would be the fault

1083
02:37:53,131 --> 02:37:55,758
of the man who was like
a father to me.

1084
02:37:57,594 --> 02:37:59,345
A mad man!

1085
02:38:00,054 --> 02:38:03,433
He wasn't mad.
I hated him at first.

1086
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:06,352
But as time went by...

1087
02:38:07,854 --> 02:38:09,731
I understood his advice.

1088
02:38:11,941 --> 02:38:14,319
And I understood your silence.

1089
02:38:15,987 --> 02:38:18,239
But I never found that note.

1090
02:38:20,783 --> 02:38:22,994
I covered it with my own hands.

1091
02:38:24,954 --> 02:38:28,583
I didn't see it,
there's no other explanation.

1092
02:38:28,708 --> 02:38:31,669
No point explaining any more.

1093
02:38:33,254 --> 02:38:35,006
That's how it was.

1094
02:38:36,424 --> 02:38:38,801
But Alfredo didn't betray you.

1095
02:38:38,927 --> 02:38:41,387
He knew you better than anyone.

1096
02:38:45,433 --> 02:38:48,144
If you'd chosen to stay with me,
you'd never have made any films.

1097
02:38:48,269 --> 02:38:50,355
And that would have been
a great pity.

1098
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:54,400
They're such beautiful films.
I've seen them all.

1099
02:38:57,654 --> 02:39:00,323
But you shouldn't have
changed your name.

1100
02:39:01,908 --> 02:39:03,743
What's wrong with your name?

1101
02:40:19,068 --> 02:40:21,613
He left this for you.

1102
02:40:36,711 --> 02:40:43,301
When they showed your films
on television, he was happy.

1103
02:40:45,386 --> 02:40:49,766
He just sat in front of the TV
and forgot all his ailments.

1104
02:40:52,727 --> 02:40:56,314
He knew every single word
by heart.

1105
02:40:56,439 --> 02:41:00,193
And I told him what
the images were.

1106
02:41:00,318 --> 02:41:05,865
And when you were in the papers,
he'd make me read it again and again.

1107
02:41:10,662 --> 02:41:12,246
He never asked to see me?

1108
02:41:12,372 --> 02:41:15,249
No. Never.

1109
02:41:16,876 --> 02:41:18,878
Your mother once said

1110
02:41:19,837 --> 02:41:23,132
you'd come if he wanted you to.

1111
02:41:24,759 --> 02:41:27,428
He was furious. He said,

1112
02:41:27,553 --> 02:41:32,016
"No. Toto must never
return to Giancaldo."

1113
02:41:34,936 --> 02:41:37,522
He wasn't being mean.

1114
02:41:37,647 --> 02:41:39,357
He was a good man.

1115
02:41:40,817 --> 02:41:43,444
Who knows what went through
his head?

1116
02:41:44,987 --> 02:41:49,075
He started saying strange things
towards the end.

1117
02:41:51,828 --> 02:41:54,622
Just before he closed his eyes...

1118
02:41:55,873 --> 02:41:59,711
he told your mother
not to let you know.

1119
02:42:13,975 --> 02:42:18,938
1977, 1976, 1968...

1120
02:42:43,337 --> 02:42:45,173
Moby Dick.

1121
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:49,927
Dreams in a Drawer.

1122
02:42:50,762 --> 02:42:52,430
The Challenge.

1123
02:42:53,264 --> 02:42:55,266
The Searchers.

1124
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:00,980
Magnificent Obsession.

1125
02:43:03,441 --> 02:43:05,359
Il Grido.

1126
02:43:17,622 --> 02:43:21,751
"Forgive me, Salvatore.

1127
02:43:24,212 --> 02:43:26,672
"One day I'll tell you
what happened.

1128
02:43:27,673 --> 02:43:30,802
"I'm so sorry I couldn't see you.

1129
02:43:30,927 --> 02:43:34,764
"Unfortunately, I'm leaving
with my mother tonight.

1130
02:43:35,848 --> 02:43:39,393
"We're moving to Tuscany.

1131
02:43:41,145 --> 02:43:44,357
"But I love only you.

1132
02:43:45,107 --> 02:43:48,277
"I'll never love anyone else,
I swear.

1133
02:43:50,404 --> 02:43:55,076
"I'm giving you the address
of a friend for you to write.

1134
02:43:57,328 --> 02:43:59,163
"Don't ever leave me.

1135
02:44:02,083 --> 02:44:04,502
"I love you.

1136
02:44:05,795 --> 02:44:07,755
"Elena"

1137
02:44:11,801 --> 02:44:12,927
<i>When do you leave?</i>

1138
02:44:15,346 --> 02:44:17,223
This afternoon.

1139
02:44:18,558 --> 02:44:22,311
Elena, maybe in future we can...

1140
02:44:22,436 --> 02:44:27,233
There is no future, Salvatore.
Only the past.

1141
02:44:29,151 --> 02:44:32,238
Even what happened yesterday
is only a dream.

1142
02:44:32,363 --> 02:44:34,073
A marvellous dream.

1143
02:44:36,701 --> 02:44:38,828
We never did it when we were young.

1144
02:44:40,413 --> 02:44:41,581
Remember?

1145
02:44:44,709 --> 02:44:47,920
<i>I couldn't have hoped for
a better ending.</i>

1146
02:44:55,094 --> 02:44:57,305
I'll never agree with you.

1147
02:44:58,890 --> 02:45:00,766
Never, Elena.

1148
02:46:43,744 --> 02:46:46,247
The square is mine!

1149
02:47:11,981 --> 02:47:14,817
Check the leader.
Roll when you're ready.

1150
02:47:14,942 --> 02:47:18,529
OK. Congratulations,
I loved your film.

1151
02:47:20,197 --> 02:47:23,743
- Well?
- The film's being distributed.

1152
02:47:23,868 --> 02:47:28,622
There'll be a press conference
with the actors, producer...

1153
02:47:28,748 --> 02:47:33,919
The prize has just been announced and
the telegrams are already mounting.

1154
02:47:34,587 --> 02:47:37,298
Aren't you happy?

1155
02:47:37,423 --> 02:47:40,009
Yes, of course. We'll talk later.

1156
02:51:00,709 --> 02:51:05,005
THE END
